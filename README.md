## Hi, I'm Chris Swan

### Work

I'm an Engineer at [The @ Company](https://atsign.com/), building the protocol and platform for post surveillance capitalism identity that puts people in control of their own data.

Further background on my [LinkedIn Profile](http://linkedin.com/in/chrisswan).

### Things you'll find here

#### My repos

* [FaaSonK8s](https://github.com/cpswan/FaaSonK8s) - A list of Functions as a Service (FaaS) serverless platforms that run on Kubernetes.
* [hyde-msp-example](https://github.com/cpswan/hyde-msp-example) - Example of multiple single pages on Hugo using the Hyde theme.

[chris.swanz.net](https://chris.swanz.net/) on GitHub pages.
* [dockerfiles](https://github.com/cpswan/dockerfiles) - Source for my [Docker Hub builds](https://hub.docker.com/u/cpswan).
The only one that's really active these days is [Node-RED](https://hub.docker.com/r/cpswan/node-red),
but you shouldn't use it as they long ago started publisheding their own [official Node-RED Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red).
* [RPi_sousvide](https://github.com/cpswan/RPi_sousvide) - is the code used for my
[Raspberry Pi controlled sous vide water bath](http://blog.thestateofme.com/2013/03/31/raspberry-pi-sous-vide-water-bath/).

#### Forked repos

Sometimes I fork stuff just so that I have a point in time copy. Other times I fork stuff to contribute a change, typically docs
fixes when I've struggled through installing something. Most recently I forked all of
[The @ Foundation](https://github.com/atsign-foundation) repos to add guidelines and templates (and to set up for future contributions).

#### Open sourced work stuff

* [labels](https://github.com/atsign-company/labels) is a repo to push a standard set of labels to the other repos we use so that we have consistent labeling.
More on the [Managing GitHub Labels](https://blog.atsign.dev/managing-github-labels-cknkggyk600utcqs144h8apz9) post over at [blog.atsign.dev](https://blog.atsign.dev/).
* [at_dockerfiles](https://github.com/atsign-company/at_dockerfiles) has examples and automation for multi architecture (x86_64, Arm, Arm64) images for Dart.
* [DXC Online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/) is 'a novel set of hands on learning modules which cover both cultural and
technical aspects of DevOps'.
