## Hi, I'm Chris Swan

### Work

I'm CTO for Delivery ([company bio](https://thrive.dxc.technology/experts/chris-swan/)) at [DXC Technology](https://www.dxc.technology/), the IT services company that came from the merger of CSC and HP Enterprise Services.

Further background on my [LinkedIn Profile](http://linkedin.com/in/chrisswan).

### Things you'll find here

#### My repos

* [FaaSonK8s](https://github.com/cpswan/FaaSonK8s) - A list of Functions as a Service (FaaS) serverless platforms that run on Kubernetes.
* [dockerfiles](https://github.com/cpswan/dockerfiles) - Source for my [Docker Hub builds](https://hub.docker.com/u/cpswan). The only one that's really active these days is [Node-RED](https://hub.docker.com/r/cpswan/node-red), but you shouldn't use it as they long ago started publisheding their own [official Node-RED Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red).
* [RPi_sousvide](https://github.com/cpswan/RPi_sousvide) - is the code used for my [Raspberry Pi controlled sous vide water bath](http://blog.thestateofme.com/2013/03/31/raspberry-pi-sous-vide-water-bath/). I really need to find some time to update it to Python 3.

#### Forked repos

Sometimes I fork stuff just so that I have a point in time copy. Other times I fork stuff to contribute a change, typically docs fixes when I've struggled through installing something. Most recently I did some tweaks to [DXC's open source online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/).

### Writing

I have a [blog](http://blog.thestateofme.com/) and also write about DevOps, Cloud and Security stuff at [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/profile/Chris-Swan/).
